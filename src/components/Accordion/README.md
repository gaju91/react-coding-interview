# 📌 Accordion Component  

An Accordion is a UI component that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It is commonly used in FAQs, menus, or to organize large amounts of information into collapsible sections.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ Each section has a title and content.  
✅ Clicking on a title toggles (opens/closes) the content.  
✅ Can allow one or multiple sections to be open at a time.  
✅ Can include smooth animations for better user experience.  

## 🖼️ Example UI Structure  
```
+--------------------------------+
|  ➕ Section 1 Title            |  <-- Click to expand/collapse
+--------------------------------+
  Content of Section 1 (hidden initially)

+--------------------------------+
|  ➕ Section 2 Title            |
+--------------------------------+
  Content of Section 2 (hidden initially)
```
